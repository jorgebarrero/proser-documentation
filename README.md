Procer documentation and tips

This repository is intended to have all documentation for Proser.

We will make the offcial

- Technical development documentation
- Instalation documentation
- User documentation
- Requirements documentation

Documents can be in Spanish as separate files whith the same name and a postfix
-es Example:

README.md README-es.md

NOTE: Simple and timely direct documentation is preferable than no
documentation. Write in your favorite language and use a translator if
necessary, but document frequently, especially what is related to technology
tips since we don't want to have to repeat the learning over and over again.

If you follow the step by step of a good web page, refer to the page but also
summarize the step by step after being tested.

## Technical development documentation

Basically we will create a folder for each technology used. Inside we will have
folders or documents to a very specific topic. Markdownn is the preferrd format.
If more than one file are required, we will create a folder containg all
documents related to the topic.

Please do not mix topics.

get the intalation done.
