### Ubuntu 18.04:

git-flow AVH edition is packaged with Ubuntu. You can install the last version
of git-flow AVH Edition using:

\$ sudo apt-get install git-flow

## Recommendations

I recommend that you install two extensions of vscode Git Graph and BABA-Git
flow

Once the repositories are cloned

npm install

In each one

and then initialize with git flow (tioenes that install git flow in your mauina
first)

Ubuntu 18.04:

git-flow AVH edition is packaged with Ubuntu. You can install the last version
of git-flow AVH Edition using: \$ sudo apt-get install git-flow

After initializing the repository with git-flow you use the command scheme
(ctrl + may + p) you write git-flow and all the necessary commands appear

git-flow inint

initialize the local repository and ask the configuration questions (use the
default values ​​minus the prefix that I put v)

From then on, the system simply creates a branch automatically for each feature
and automatically destroys it when you finish it.

git-flow start (branch name) git-flow finisf (branch name)

you can do several branches and work in several simultaneously

then they all mix and come to develop

Master is passed only after trying everything

so the final destination is always develop
